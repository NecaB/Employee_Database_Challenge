# Employee_Database_Challenge
Project Overview
Pewlett Hackard required information from its employee database to assist with some administrative and human relations decisions regarding upcoming retirements and potential mentorship programs to assist with the retirements. To provide this information we performed data modelling, analysis and engineering. This entailed utilizing advanced queries and joins, importing data into a database, aliasing, filtering, and creating new tables.
 
Results
Table 1 
-       The table consisting of employee number, first name, last name, title, from-date and to-date after the initial query for the number of Retirees that was ran returned 133, 766 rows.
 
Table 2 
The table generated based on the query modified for duplicates and errors based on changes that may have occurred over the years to employee information ie. changes in job titles or promotion was ran which then returned
-       90,398 employees. This was a more current and accurate representation as this accounted for most recent job titles if there were changes over the years working at Pewlett Hackard. 

Table 3 
The data utilized for this query consists of
-       Employee number, first name, last name, title, from-date and to-date. This table displayed a list of upcoming retirees in the next few years as well as their most recent title.
 
Table 4 
The table with employees’ titles and sum returned 7 rows, this showed the specific titles and employees that will retire in the next few years.

Mentorship Eligibility
The query to determined eligibility for the mentorship program returned a table which consists of employee number, first name, last name birth date and from date, to title date and had 1549 rows
 
Summary
The reports provided the number of employees that are approaching retirement along with their titles. However, a greater understanding of the exact departments that would be affected will provide an opportunity for Pewlett- Hackard to better prepare for these upcoming changes in their Human Relations department.
-The specific number of employees per department that will retire will give Pewlett Hackard the opportunity to get new hires, merge or remove obsolete roles and tittles. 

This data retrieved will also now provide information to address future issues such as mentoring and grooming of new employees to prepare for the current upcoming roles and effects of the retirement but also have the strategies to employ to mitigate the effects if there’s a reoccurrence of this in the future.
